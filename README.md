# wine_market_ml_project

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the US wine industry for a French wine company. Uti-
lizing a data-driven approach, our goal was to extract actionable insights critical for the clientâ€™s market
implantation strategy. Focused on the broader US and Californian markets, our analysis encompassed
segmentation analysis, gross margins, sales volumes, consumption trends, and predictive forecasting.
While successful in multiple facets, we faced challenges in forecasting gross margins due to data limita-
tions. Our findings shed light on market trends, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making
and strategy formulation.
